# HTML5 Messaging Demos

This is a self-contained project that is designed provide you a platform for experimenting with primarily WebSockets (as demonstrated at [Web Directions Code 2012](code12melb.webdirections.org)), although it could also be for demoing other concepts with server and client component.  Once you hack through the code you'll probably get an idea how.

## Installing

The demo console is powered using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) so you will need to have this installed on your machine to play around with it.  Once you have this installed you should be able to clone this repo:

    git clone git://github.com/DamonOehlman/messaging-demos.git

And once cloned, you will be able to install the required node modules to make the console work, by simply running `npm install` in the project directory:

    cd messaging-demos
    npm install

## Running the Demo

Once installed you can run the demo by simply running:

    node server.js

Once the demo is running, simply open `index.html` from the file system and you should be away.
